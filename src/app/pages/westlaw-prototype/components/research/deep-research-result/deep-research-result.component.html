                    <p>The economic loss rule generally bars recovery in tort for purely economic losses arising from a breach of contract, but there are exceptions related to fraud. A claim resulting from a concealed defect likely would not be barred by the economic loss rule.</p>

                    <ol class="prelim">
                      <li>The California Supreme Court in <a href='#'>Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp.</a>held that the economic loss rule does not bar claims for intentional misrepresentation or fraud in the performance of a contract when the fraud is independent of the breach of contract (<a href="#">Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp., 34 Cal.4th 979 (2004)</a>).</li>
                      <li>In<a href="#">Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc.</a>, the court clarified that the economic loss rule does not bar tort damages in cases where the contract was fraudulently induced, including claims of intentional concealment(<a href="#">Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc., 84 Cal.App.5th 828 (2022)</a>). This suggests that if your client's claim involves fraudulent inducement, it may not be barred by the economic loss rule.</li>
                      <li>The court in <a href="#">In re Ford Motor Co. DPS6 Powershift Transmission Products Liability Litigation</a> held that fraudulent omission claims are barred by the economic loss rule when the damages are purely economic and derive from the defendant's breach of warranty obligationsÂ (<a href="#">In re Ford Motor Co. DPS6 Powershift Transmission Products Liability Litigation, 483 F.Supp.3d 838 (2020)</a>). This aligns with the general principle that the economic loss rule bars tort recovery for economic damages unless accompanied by physical harm or personal injury<a href="#">(In re Ford Motor Co. DPS6 Powershift Transmission Products Liability Litigation, 483 F.Supp.3d 838 (2020)</a>).</li>
                      <li>The court in<a href="#">Foster Poultry Farms v. Alkar-Rapidpak-MP Equipment, Inc.</a> emphasized that to maintain a fraud claim based on the same factual allegations as a breach of contract claim, the plaintiff must show that the duty giving rise to tort liability is either completely independent of the contract or arises from conduct that is both intentional and intended to harm <a href="#">(Foster Poultry Farms v. Alkar-Rapidpak-MP Equipment, Inc., 868 F.Supp.2d 983 (2012)</a>).</li>

                    <p>In California, the economic loss rule generally bars recovery of purely economic losses in tort actions, limiting recovery to contract remedies. There are exceptions, particularly in cases involving fraud.</p>

                    <p>The economic loss rule may not bar the fraud claim If your client can establish that:</p>

                        <li>The duty to disclose the defect involves a separate duty to disclose that arises independently of the contract.</li>
                        <li>The concealment exposed your client to a risk of harm beyond what was reasonably contemplated by the parties when they entered the contract; and Â </li>
                        <li>your client relied on the omission to their detriment.</li>

                      <li>Fraud-based claims can be excluded from the reach of the economic loss rule, but only when the fraudulent conduct at issue is independent from the breach of a contractual promise. See <a href="#" class="link" (click)="showPopover($event)" (mouseleave)="hideWithDelay()">Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp., 34 Cal. 4th 979, 991 (2004)</a>. For garden-variety fraud cases, the fraud exemption is ânarrow in scope and limited to a defendant's affirmative representations on which a plaintiff relies, and which expose a plaintiff to liability for personal damages independent of the plaintiff's economic loss.â Representations only concern the âquality or character of the goods soldâ and are not actionable. <a href='#'>Klein v.

                      <li>A person may not ordinarily recover in tort for the breach of duties that merely restate contractual obligations. Instead, â '[c]ourts will generally enforce the breach of a contractual promise through contract law, except when the actions that constitute the breach violate a social policy that merits the imposition of tort remedies.

                    <h4>Characterizations against preclusion</h4>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Tort damages have been permitted in contract cases where a breach of duty directly causes physical injury where the contract was fraudulently induced. Â The economic loss rule does not bar fraud and intentional misrepresentation claims if they are independent of a breach of contract claim. <a href="#" class="link" (click)="showPopover($event)" (mouseleave)="hideWithDelay()">Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp., 34 Cal.4th 979 (Cal., 2004)</a>.</li>
                      <li>The duty that gives rise to tort liability is either completely independent of the contract or arises from conduct which is both intentional and intended to harm. Â Robinson did not hold that any claims for fraudulent inducement are barred by the economic loss rule. Quite the contrary, the Robinson court affirmed that tort damages are available in contract cases where the contract was fraudulently induced. <a href="#" class="link" (click)="showPopover($event)" (mouseleave)="hideWithDelay()">Dhital v.

                      <li>The economic loss rule does not act as an absolute bar to tort recovery in every case in which the parties have a contractual relationship. Courts generally permit tort suits if the defendant allegedly violated a duty rooted in tort principles that is independent of the parties' contractual rights and obligations and exposed the plaintiff to a risk of harm beyond the parties' reasonable contemplation when they entered into the contract. <a href="#" class="link" (click)="showPopover($event)" (mouseleave)="hideWithDelay()">Rattagan v.

                      <li>This distinction is not arbitrary and does not rest on the âluckâ of one plaintiff in having an accident causing physical injury. The distinction rests, rather, on an understanding of the nature of the responsibility a manufacturer must undertake in distributing his products. He can appropriately be held liable for physical injuries caused by defects by requiring his goods to match a standard of safety defined in terms of conditions that create unreasonable risks of harm. He cannot be held for the level of performance of his products in the consumer's business unless he agrees that the product was designed to meet the consumer's demands. <a href="#" class="link" (click)="showPopover($event)" (mouseleave)="hideWithDelay()">Scherer v.

                    <h4>Arguments for preclusion</h4>
                    <p>These are some of the arguments that manufacturers of defective products are likely to argue when a purchaser of the product seeks damages beyond the contract:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><b>Lack of Physical Injury:</b> The manufacturer will likely argue that there is no physical injury or property damage. </li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Under the economic loss rule, there is no recovery in tort for negligently inflicted purely economic losses, meaning financial harm unaccompanied by physical or property damage. <a href="#" class="link" (click)="showPopover($event)" (mouseleave)="hideWithDelay()">Sheen v.

                      <li><b>Damages Not Reasonably Contemplated by Contract:</b> The manufacturer could contend that there was no independent duty to disclose the defect outside of the contractual obligations.</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>No risk of harm beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties. When applying the exception for fraudulent inducement to the economic loss rule courts have focused on there being an additional injury or damage that could not be reasonably contemplated in the contract. <a href="#" class="link" (click)="showPopover($event)" (mouseleave)="hideWithDelay()">Klein v.

                      <li><b>Pure Economic Loss:</b> The manufacturer may argue that the purchaserâs losses are purely economic damages from disappointed economic expectations.</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Fraud claims that merely take the allegations supporting a straightforward breach of contract claim and recast them as torts are barred by the economic loss rule. <a href="#" class="link" (click)="showPopover($event)" (mouseleave)="hideWithDelay()">JMP Securities LLP v.

                      <li><b>Public Policy Arguments:</b> The manufacturer may argue that contract related disputes should remain within contract law and allowing the purchaser to collect damages for fraud and contract would result in double recovery.</li>

                    <p>These are some of the arguments that purchasers of defective products are likely to argue in cases where the manufacturer failed to disclose a defect in the product:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><b>Independent Tort Duty:</b> The purchaser may contend that the manufacturer had a duty to disclose the defect due to the relationship between the parties or specific circumstances, such as safety concerns.</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The independent tort duty to refrain from engaging in fraudulent conduct is well established by statute and common law. <a href="#" class="link" (click)="showPopover($event)" (mouseleave)="hideWithDelay()">Rattagan v.

                      <ul>
                        <li>The California Supreme Court set forth an exception to the economic loss rule when âthe duty that gives rise to tort liability is either completely independent of the contract or arises from conduct which is both intentional and intended to harm.â <a href="#" class="link" (click)="showPopover($event)" (mouseleave)="hideWithDelay()">Robinson Helicopter Co. v.

                      <li><b>Harm Beyond Contract Rights:</b> Purchaser will likely argue that fraudulent inducement by concealment is independent of the contract and falls outside of the economic loss rule because the manufacturer exposed them to risks beyond those contemplated in the contract.</li>

                        <li>TheÂ economicÂ lossÂ ruleÂ states that a party to a contract cannot recover âpurely economic lossâ in tort, âunless he can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise.â <a href="#" class="link" (click)="showPopover($event)" (mouseleave)="hideWithDelay()">Rattagan v.

                      <li><b>Public Policy Arguments:</b> The purchaser might argue that allowing a fraud claim promotes fairness and deters unethical business practices. Public policy should not permit a manufacturer to escape liability for intentionally concealing product defects.

                    <ol>
                      <li><b>Florida Courts:</b> Florida courts generally recognize a fraud exception to the economic loss rule. In Florida, if a party can prove that fraud occurred, they may be able to pursue tort claims even if the losses are purely economic and related to a contract.</li>
                      <li><b>California Courts:</b> California courts also recognize a fraud exception to the economic loss rule. They allow claims for fraud in the inducement of a contract, meaning if a party was fraudulently led into entering a contract, they can seek tort remedies.</li>
                      <li><b>New York Courts:</b> New York takes a narrower approach. The fraud exception is recognized, but the fraud must be "extraneous" to the contract. This means the fraudulent behavior must be separate from the contract terms themselves, not just a breach of contract disguised as fraud.</li>
                      <li><b>Illinois Courts:</b> Illinois courts generally do not recognize a broad fraud exception to the economic loss rule. The rule is applied strictly to maintain the boundary between contract and tort law. However, exceptions may exist if the fraud involves a duty independent of the contract.</li>
                      <li><b>Texas Courts:</b> Texas courts allow for a fraud exception but emphasize the need for a clear distinction between a tort duty and a contractual obligation. The fraud must be independent of the contract terms to pursue a tort claim.</li>
                      <li><b>Michigan Courts:</b> Michigan courts have a more restrictive view, often limiting the fraud exception. The focus is on whether the fraud is separate from the contract obligations, similar to New York's approach.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Some states do not apply the ELR or have exceptions to it, including Oklahoma and Tennessee (where the ELR applies onlyÂ to products liability cases). Texas (where the courts have prohibited the application of the ELR as a defense to various statutory claims) and Colorado (where the courts have ruled the Colorado Legislature has the power to create causes of action that trump the ELR).Â </p>

                    the employer generally has more flexibility to terminate employment for any lawful reason, including social media activity, provided it does not violate public policy or statutory rights. Employers must evaluate whether the comment violates company policies or codes of conduct, such as those related to harassment, discrimination, confidentiality, or bringing the organization into disrepute. It's important to differentiate between comments made in a personal capacity and those that could be construed as representative of the company. Additionally, the impact of the comment on the workplace environment or company reputation should be carefully considered.

                  <p>Legal considerations also play a significant role in determining the permissibility of such a termination. In many jurisdictions, employees may have protections related to free speech, privacy, or engaging in "concerted activities" under labor laws, especially if the comments pertain to working conditions.

                    In <a href="#">Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S. Ct. 1731 (1968)</a>, the U.S. Supreme Court established that public employees have a right to speak on matters of public concern without fear of retaliation. However, this right must be balanced against the government's interest as an employer.
                    The case of <a href="#">Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 103 S. Ct. 1684 (1983)</a> further refined this standard, emphasizing that speech must relate to matters of public concern to receive First Amendment protection. </p>

                  <p>The NLRA safeguards employees' rights to engage in "concerted activities" for mutual aid or protection, which can include discussions about working conditions on social media, as seen in
                    <a href="#">Three D, LLC v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd., 629 F. App'x 33 (2d Cir. 2015).</a>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The NLRA further supports employee rights in cases such as
                    <a href="#">Hispanics United of Buffalo, Inc., 355 NLRB No. 37 (December 14, 2012)</a>
                    where the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that discussing work conditions on social media is protected, and firing for such comments violated the NLRA. The context of the social media comment is crucial in determining the legality of termination circle-question. Comments that are discriminatory, reveal confidential information, or contravene company policies are more likely to be lawful grounds for termination, as indicated in
                    <a href="#">Pappas v. Giuliani, 290 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2002).</a>
                    Conversely, comments relating to working conditions, union activities, or other protected speech may be shielded from employer retaliation, as noted in
                    <a href="#">Matter of Richardson v. Saratoga Springs, 246 A.D.2d 900, 667 N.Y.S.2d 995 (N.Y. App. Div. 1998).</a>

                    New York Labor Law Section 201-d prohibits discrimination against employees for legal "political activities" and "recreational activities" conducted outside work hours, potentially covering social media use. Nonetheless, this protection may not apply if the content itself is the issue, as illustrated in
                    <a href="#">Sander v. Westchester Reform Temple, 2024 N.Y. Slip Op. 3064 (N.Y. App. Div. 2024), </a>
                    where an employee was discharged for the content of a blog post. It may depend on whether the comment related to political or recreational activities, and whether it was made during work hours
